# Hello, World👋! I’m Russel

I’m a first year IT student who enjoys building things and breaking them just to understand how they work. I focus on frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while strengthening my problem solving skills with C, C++, C#, and Python. I use Git and .NET in my projects and genuinely enjoy debugging because every bug feels like solving a puzzle. Still learning, still building, and improving every day.
